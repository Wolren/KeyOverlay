The purpose of this app is to make one able to count and see how fast they click by using overlays that appear on top of other apps.
Overlays have three possible options: Keyboard Overlay, Mouse Overlay, and Key Overlay. The last option is customizable.
The to-do list includes adding different keyboard layouts, improved graphics, and more customization options.
